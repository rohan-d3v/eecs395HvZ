          HvZ Core would like to hear your feedback about the current game of HvZ. Although we make strong attempts
          to keep HvZ out of non-players' lives, we realize that there may be some instances that we have not yet
          addressed in our rules. Please inform us of any situations which you feel should be corrected.
